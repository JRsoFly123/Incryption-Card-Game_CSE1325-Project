# CSE1325-Project
This is a group project for Object-oriented programming. We thought of making a card-based that is similar to the game Inscryption and I have attached a basic idea of what it can look like. The user will go against an opponent by picking a card/s (a screen will show several to choose from) that have health and attack power. Once they have chosen them, they will be able to play them on the "field" with the use of buttons that are displayed and will have the ability to end their turn. The opponent will also have cards to place(still have not decided whether their decisions will be fixed or not) which will be shown before the user can pick/place cards. Once the turn has ended, the cards will attack the spot above or below them which will either have a card or nothing. If it is a card, the card will lose health based on the attack power of the card that did the hit. If there was no card, the opponent or the user will lose health based on the cards attack power. The game will end once the opponent or the user has taken too much damage. Before entering the game, the user can set their own name and possibly choose an avatar which will be displayed. There will also be a tutorial button that can display the basic rules of the game and see all the available cards.
